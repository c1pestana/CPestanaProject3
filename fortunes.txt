Never forget to check the weather
if you dig a hole for someone else you will fall into it
a lie travels around the world while truth is putting her boots on
anger can be an expensive luxury
six feet of earth make all men equal
a ship in the harbor is safe
flies do not enter a closed mouth
never test the depth of a river with both feet
you cannot get to the top by sitting on your bottom
tomorrow is often the busiest day of the week
don't sell the skin until you caught the bear
when you say one thing, the clever person hears three
eyebrows are sisters not twins
if you do not have a plan for your life someone else will
keep a couple wet wipes in case a bum try to touch you
yolo
butterflies only live where its warm
do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind
float like a butterfly sting like a bee
stop drop and roll
